  <summary>General advice</summary>


  <p>The course you have just enrolled in is an intense course but don’t worry, by the end of the course you will see how far you have come and how much you have learned. Our students often tell us that Term 1 is less intense than Term 2, but we believe that depends on your background. Our students have a highly diverse range of backgrounds, and there will always be some students with very little experience of each particular subject. So don’t panic if you haven’t, for example, studied epidemiology before. Each module starts with the basics and, if you work hard, you will be on a steep learning curve and will reach a high level of understanding by the end of the course, even from a standing start.

Term 1 and Term 2 are constituted of the teaching modules and Term 3 is fully dedicated to the research project. The Term 1 modules will give you a solid foundation in epidemiology, statistics, and handling healthcare data, with an introduction to molecular epidemiology and a revision of course statistical and epidemiological concepts. You also get to brush-up or learn new programming skills with some of the Term 1 modules. Term 2 modules are more mathematically and computationally heavy but are all very practical and always aim to put things into the real-world context. Term 3 is where you get to put many of the things you have learned into practice on your individual research project. There are many group projects throughout the year where you apply many of the things you have learned but Term 3 is where you, as an individual, get to shine and really develop your research skills.

It an intense but very rewarding year. And to help to lower the gradient of your learning curve we have put together some some preparatory study ahead of the course in areas that you are less familiar with. This page aims to give you some pointers on how to spend that pre-course preparation time. There are some FAQs at the end of the page which aim to answer some questions more related to practical and organisational things. There is also a list of contacts in case you have any additional questions..</p>

  <summary>How to spend your preparation time</summary>
  <p></b>Statistics</b>
  
While the term 1 statistics course starts with the basics, the whole HDA course is based around a solid understanding of statistics and many concepts can take time to digest. So, if your stats is a bit rusty, you can make things easier on yourself by brushing ahead of the course. When you get to the machine learning module, an understanding of linear algebra will be a great asset. The course does provide optional maths refreshers in term one, which cover linear algebra, but if you haven’t studied it before then some pre-course revision may well be beneficial.

For a revision of statistical concepts we highly recommend you begin your preparation by following the first few weeks of the Imperial Introduction to Statistics for Public Health course. This is particularly useful if you have not done any basic maths or statistics in some time.

If you still have time (after the coding prep and computer set-up in the sections further below), here are some other useful statistics and linear algebra resources.

Learning to code
Everything we do on the HDA course is underpinned by an ability to code. As with everything else, you will be well trained in coding throughout the course, and we do not assume or require any prior experience. However, in the very early stages of learning to code it can take a long time to solve simple problems, so you can certainly make things easier on yourself by getting through this very early stage before the course, so you’re not doing the frustrating slow bit at the same time as studying epidemiology, statistics, etc.

The HDA course primarily uses R. If you don’t have R already installed on your computer, you can follow the instructions provided on this webpage in the section Setting up your computer. There are numerous free or cheap resources online for getting started, some of which are recommended below in Free R resources.

Once you have set up R, the course team highly recommends you complete the below courses on DataCamp, before induction week. To access the DataCamp courses, you need to use your Imperial email account.

Introduction to R
Intermediate R
Data Visualization in R
Introduction to Importing Data in R
If you are already familiar with R or you are a beginner and have completed the above, here are some more advanced courses from DataCamp you might want to complete:

  <summary>Setting up your computer</summary>
  
  <p>You will be using R extensively throughout the year. R is a widely used programming language for statistical analyses and machine learning (see https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and can be aided by the use of Rstudio (highly recommended), which is a graphical user interface for R. To use both of these in the course, you will need to install R, Rstudio and some R packages on your personal laptop. Please follow the instructions below to complete the installation prior to course commencement. We will have a dedicated session during induction week to help troubleshoot any problems you encounter with the installation.

<b>Installing R</b>
First download and install R (version 4.4.1) from the CRAN.

R for Mac OS X

For Mac users

Download R-4.4.1 for Windows. The R-project for statistical computing.

  <summary>Advice from previous HDA students</summary>
  
  <p>We asked former students of the HDA course what advice they would give their past selves before starting the course. Their responses are below.

<b>Before starting the course</b>

My advice would be: if you are a biologist and have not done maths in a while, take a linear algebra course as a MOOC maybe. If you have questions, ask! Never be afraid of being curious!

Don’t be disheartened when you don’t have a clue what’s happening in R or python if you have zero prior coding experience - it’s a steep learning curve but you’ll pick it up. Coding is the sort of thing where there’s a certain level of understanding beyond which everything just seems very understandable, and before that level it just seems super overwhelming. Just the ability to understand the syntax in R and the different nuances etc gives you the ability to understand and search every problem on stack overflow. You don’t need to know a load of functions off by heart.

If possible, do some of the data camp courses BEFORE starting the MSc

Take an intro linear algebra course and don’t just rely on the math refreshers

<b>Throughout the course</b>

Organise and document everything during projects: scripts, data, notes etc. You will definitely revisit old code and old notes

Be proactive, ask question and use the resources that are made available to you (the people around you and the lecturers)
Keep your notes and code organised, I kept referring back to past tutorials in the project, and having a filing system from the beginning of the project made this so much quicker.

Don’t think you’re the only one who doesn’t understand something. There’s a huge range of pre-existing skills and knowledge in the other people in the class and inevitably you’ll know less about some stuff and more about other stuff than your pals

Especially with the wide range of skill sets in the program, whenever I didn’t get something I knew at least a quarter of our program did and had to fight my self consciousness to ask the question. Also lecturers are really nice I would have asked a few more questions had I not been worried about looking like an idiot

Get to know the people on the course and work with them – everyone has different strengths and will pick things up at different rates and it really helped this year working together to understand things.

Capitalise on your classmates’ knowledge! It’s a nice symbiotic relationship

Start projects earlier.

Revise the second term lectures such that there are some baby steps leading to the big equations

Summer quarter advice - make sure they have data you want to work with.

Advice for the thesis: get your references and stuff organised and maybe don’t wait too much before writing some stuff.</p>

  <summary>Frequently Asked Questions</summary>
  
  <b><p>1. Do you have any suggestions for finding accommodation in London?</b>
When searching for accommodation, take note of the campus where most of your classes will be delivered. The MSc Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning course is based at the White City Campus in West London. However, some of your classes might take place at the Charing Cross Campus in Hammersmith and in the South Kensington Campus but the majority will be held at White City in the School of Public Health.

For additional information on accommodation, visit the Imperial College Accommodation website.

<b>2. How much money will I need to live and study in London for a year?</b>
Please visit the Imperial Living in London website for detailed information.

You will need to travel between campuses by bus, bicycle or underground train. Some journeys may be convenient on foot.

<b>3. What is my tuition fee status?</b>
Please visit the Imperial Fees and Funding website for the most up to date information on tuition fees.

<b>4. How and when should I send official documents (e.g. degree certificates)?</b>
Official documents need to be sent to Registry as soon as they are requested . Please check My Imperial portal for instructions on how to send these. All outstanding conditions of your offer will have to be met before you can be offered an unconditional place and register as a student. Registering as a student is a pre-requisite for joining the course. For any questions regarding your documents and outstanding conditions, you can contact Registry directly

<b>5. When does the course start?</b>

The MSc Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning Course starts on 30th of September 2024. Further details of the first week of term (i.e. ‘Induction Week’) will be sent via email.</b>

For international students, Imperial College London organises some orientation events prior to the official start of the course. Please visit the International Students Webpages for further information.

<b>6. I’m an international student – what else should I consider or do before my arrival?</b>
Please bear in mind that you may need a visa and vaccinations before your arrival. If you think you will not be able to obtain the visa in time for the start of the course please contact the Postgraduate Education Coordinator, Jo Tite: j.tite at imperial.ac.uk

You may also want to familiarise yourself with information on how to open a bank account, and how to find a general medical practitioner (GP) after your arrival. Options for GP services include the Imperial College Health Centre in South Kensington or other services closer to your chosen accommodation.

Please also make active use of the general information resources for international students at Imperial.

<b>7. Where does teaching take place?</b>
Teaching takes place most at the White City Campus in the School of Public Health. Occasionally you might have some classes in South Kensington and in Hammersmith. This will depend on the modules taken.

Please familiarise yourself with Imperial campuses and maps

Note: The name of the campus may not correspond to the name of the nearest Underground station. For example, the Charing Cross campus is not near the Charing Cross tube station (but is between Hammersmith and Baron’s Court stations), and the Hammersmith campus is not near Hammersmith station.

<b>8. Do you have a reading list of books to prepare for the course?</b>
We encourage you to do some general preparatory reading; we have attached a list of key texts. However, we do not anticipate prior learning in the subject matters, and the modules are taught starting from a basic level – so there will be adequate opportunities to learn the subjects even if you have never taken these modules beforehand. During term time, you would need to dedicate the allotted time for independent study as well as actively attend the live sessions and lectures.

<b>Is there other preparation that I should do before starting the course?</b>
You will be required to use software to prepare written reports and prepare slides to accompany presentations. Our computer facilities (see below) offer you access to Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint and Word for this purpose. If you are not familiar with these programmes, you might want to familiarise yourself with them before the course commences. Other software such as R for statistical analysis will be taught on the Course (please see the accompanying R preparation guide). In addition, communication and teaching software such as padlet will be introduced in induction week.

<b>10. Will I need to buy a calculator?</b>
You will need to do calculations for practicals and homework, where you can use laptops and/or mobile phones, so it may not be necessary to buy a calculator.

If you decide to buy a calculator, we recommend that you use the CASIO fx-85GT Plus (£9-10). However, any standard scientific calculator should also be fine, so if you already have one, there is no need to buy another one. Importantly, you should check that the calculator has functions to calculate log (bases 2 and 10), exponentials, arithmetic means, standard deviations (S.D.), variance, geometric means, and square roots. We advise that you become familiar with these basic functions of your calculator before your arrival.

<b>11. What books do I need to buy for the course?</b>
There is a core reading list of texts in addition to the books recommended for your pre-sessional reading. You will receive a handbook containing links to the core reading lists, when you arrive. These key texts will be available in the library (and mostly online), so choosing to buy any of the books will be up to you in case you want to retain a personal copy.

<b>12. Do I need to choose my own summer project topic?</b>
The summer months in Term 3 are dedicated to full-time work on a research project. We provide students with a list of potential summer project topics at the start of Term 2 (in January), and advise that you start thinking about possible projects before this. Alternatively, you may wish to submit your own project ideas for approval. Your idea for a summer project, must be supported by a member of staff within the School of Public Health who is also willing to supervise the project. If you already have project ideas in mind, please discuss these with your personal tutor or the course organisers soon after your arrival.

<b>13. Who should I contact if I have any further questions?</b>
If you have any further questions, please consult the following key contacts or resources:

The Registry team for queries on your application, outstanding conditions, fee status, and registration status.
Postgraduate Education Co-ordinator, Ms Jo Tite (email: j.tite at imperial.ac.uk), for queries on timetables, induction week or any other administrative issues

Please familiarise yourself with information about postgraduate studies, and further information collated for new postgraduate students before you arrive.
